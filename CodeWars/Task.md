300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence

Example 1:

Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
Example 3:

Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1

I was not able to undestand it from the MIT video _16. Dynamic Programming, Part 2: LCS, LIS, Coins_
so I decided to go through code
